What you see in this repository is the engine that I have created through my "How To Make An Undertale Fangame" series on YouTube.
Here is what it taught you per episode:
- Episode 1 - Bullet Board
- Episode 2 - Battle UI and Soul Damage
- Episode 3 - Menu Navigation and Text Writing
- Episode 4 - ACT Commands
- Episode 5 - Items
- Episode 6 - Attack Patterns and MERCY
- Episode 7 - Overworld
- Episode 8 - Cutscenes
- Episode 9 - SOUL Mechanics and SAVE
- Episode 10 - Surface Drawing, MISS/BLOCK Attacks, Flag Management and Blue/Orange Attacks

A lot of people struggled to follow just a few simple code snippets on their own, so this project file download will hopefully help with that.
There is a lot more in this project file that I didn't cover in my series, mostly because it's up to the creativity of the viewers, and this just gives them a base to work from. Most of the code is commentated, to make it just a tad bit easier to understand.

This code is for Game Maker Studio 2 ONLY. I have not tested this in 1.4 or lower, mostly because I cannot get a license to it.
Game Maker Studio 2 is not cheap software, but this should be enough for you to create your own game in the trial version (you need a license to export it to an EXE for other people to play WITHOUT giving the source code).
If anyone is skilled enough, they can translate this code to Unity, Unreal, Godot or some other free games engine, but since Undertale and Deltarune were both made in this engine, I decided to go with this one since it's the easiest one I know.

Thank you for your patience.
Yours truly, QSV
